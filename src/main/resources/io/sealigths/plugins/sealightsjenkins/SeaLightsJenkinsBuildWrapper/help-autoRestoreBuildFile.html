    SeaLights Jenkins Plugin updates the customer's build file by adding the necessary plugins automatically.<br/>
    By checking this option, SeaLights Jenkins Plugin will attempt to override the modified build file with a copy of the original one once the build is completed, basically keeping the original build file.<br/>
    Note that for some customers, this may happen too late in build pipeline (for example, after committing the files to the source control). If that's your case and you want to use the 'Restore Build File' feature, please uncheck this option and manually add the 'SeaLights - Restore Build File' Post Action where applicable in your flow.
